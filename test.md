this is a _basic_ example of **Tiptap**. Sure, there are all kind of basic text styles you’d probably expect from a text editor. But wait until you see the lists:

- That’s a bullet list with one …
- … or two list items.

Isn’t that great? And all of that is editable. But wait, there’s more. Let’s try a code block:

    body { display: none; }

I know, I know, this is impressive. It’s only the tip of the iceberg though. Give it a try and click a little bit around. Don’t forget to check the other examples too.
